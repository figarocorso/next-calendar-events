### Steps

Create a file called `credentials.json` containing the service account key file.
Edit `calendar_events.py` file introducing the calendar ID from the calendar you want to extract the events from.
The calendar ID can be obtained from the calendar settings page.
Also at that calendar settings page you should grant access to that calendar to the service account email.
